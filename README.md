# ip
Do it yourself "whatismyip" written in C using BCHS and KCGI

This was one of the first things I wrote while trying to learn how to use KCGI. There are two components that can be used independently: 1) (ip) returns your IP in HTML and 2) the other (jip) in JSON format. I use this mainly for my dynamic IP addresses that change from time to time to update DYN DNS.

This work would not have been possible without the amazing work by Kristaps Dzonsons, the author of kcgi - https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi/. Kristaps is brilliant! I admire and appreciate all of his work. Anyone using my project's code would be best served by reading about the BCHS STACK - https://learnbchs.org/.

WIP from here in terms of documentation. More soon...
